# Drawing-with-Turtle
This project involes Turtle, a module of Python that allows you to command a pointer that leaves a trail based upon coordinates in the pixels. Thus if you were to command the turtle module to draw a circle it would then find the coordinates in which the trail left behind resembles a circle. Amongst the code is also the command at which once the shapes are drawn, text is printed.
